# MonishaCBA - API Tests for PET Endpoint

This repository contains API tests written in Postman for the PET endpoint of a Swagger-based API. The tests are designed to validate various operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) on the PET resource. The tests are integrated with GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI), and the results are automatically generated and viewable in the latest build run.

## Getting Started

- **Postman**: For API test execution.
- **Newman** (optional): CLI tool to run Postman tests in the terminal.
- **Git**: To clone the repository.
- **Node.js** (if using Newman): To install Newman via npm.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/monishas99/MonishaCBA.git
